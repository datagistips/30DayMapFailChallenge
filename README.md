## #Hashtag
To communicate on social media, hashtag could be #30DayMapFailChallenge or #MapFailbruaryChallenge or #FailbruaryMapChallenge

[Choose the event hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/datagistips/status/1574530858429841408)

## 🗓 February
It will be in February considering #30DayMapChallenge takes place in November and #30DayMapFailChallenge is the opposite.

- February is 2️⃣ months after, November is 2️⃣ months before
- November = 1️⃣1️⃣, 1️⃣ + 1️⃣ = 2️⃣ and 0️⃣2️⃣ is February

Also, February may be the worst month to make a challenge because :

- The number of days is never the same. So, keeping the name #30DayMapFailChallenge would be very stupid (like the challenge 🤡)
- People concentrate their creative energy on a Valentine's Day gift 💔
