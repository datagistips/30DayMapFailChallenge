# 30DayMapFailChallenge üó∫Ô∏èü§¢üèÜüåü
The official repository for #30DayMapFailChallenge, a daily mapping challenge open to everyone who will fail in creating good maps.

The idea is for you to create the new worst map

## February
It will be in February considering #30DayMapChallenge takes place in November and #30DayMapFailChallenge is the opposite.

- February is 2 months after, November is 2 months before
- November = 11, 1 + 1 = 2 and 02 is February

Also, February may be the worst month to make a challenge because :

- The number of days is never the same. So, keeping the name #30DayMapFailChallenge would be very stupid (like the challenge)
- People concentrate their energy on choosing a Valentine's Day gift

## Hashtag
To communicate on social media, hashtag could be #30DayMapFailChallenge or #MapFailbruaryChallenge or #FailbruaryMapChallenge

For the moments, the categories are :

1. Worst colors
2. Worst data
3. Worst symbols
4. Worst scale
5. Worst projection
6. Worst resolution
7. Worst interactivity
