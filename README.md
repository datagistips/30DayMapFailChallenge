## 🗓 February
It will be in February considering #30DayMapChallenge takes place in November and #MapFailbruaryChallenge is the opposite.

- February is 2️⃣ months after, November is 2️⃣ months before
- November = 1️⃣1️⃣, 1️⃣ + 1️⃣ = 2️⃣ and 0️⃣2️⃣ is February

Also, February may be the worst month to make a challenge because people concentrate their creative energy on a Valentine's Day gift 💔
