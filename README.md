# 30DayMapFailChallenge 🗺️🤢🏆🌟
The official repository for #30DayMapChallenge, a daily mapping challenge open to everyone who will fail in creating good maps.

The idea is for you to create the new worst map

## Categories
For the moments, the categories are :

1. Worst colors
- Worst data
- Worst symbols
- Worst scale
- Worst projection
- Worst resolution
- Worst interactivity
- Rainbow is the new black
- Worst inventivity
- Worst software

## Contribute
- We need new categories (30 or 31)
- We need catchy names for each category
- A period (maybe the worst ?)
